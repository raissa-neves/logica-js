# Solution to Programming Logic Course Challenges

Practicing programming logic, including concepts like variables, conditionals (if-else), loops (while), and user interactions (alert, prompt), is essential for your software development career. These fundamentals provide the foundation for solving problems structurally, making decisions within the code, creating controlled iterations, and effectively interacting with users.

Understanding these concepts not only makes it easier to learn new languages and technologies but also enables you to create innovative solutions, debug efficiently, and maintain quality throughout the software lifecycle. Therefore, investing time in these principles early on is crucial for building a solid and successful foundation in programming.

#### Challenges

1) Display an alert with the message "Welcome to our site!"
2) Declare a variable called name and assign it the value "Lua".
3) Create a variable called age and assign it the value 25.
4) Define a variable numberOfSales and assign it the value 50.
5) Define a variable availableBalance and assign it the value 1000.
6) Display an alert with the text "Error! Please fill in all fields."
7) Declare a variable called errorMessage and assign it the value "Error! Please fill in all fields." Now display an alert with the value of the errorMessage variable.
8) Use a prompt to ask for the user's name and store it in the name variable.
9) Ask the user to enter their age using a prompt and store it in the age variable.
10) Ask the user to enter their age using a prompt and store it in the age variable. Now, if the age is 18 or older, display an alert with the message "You can get your driverâ€™s license!"
